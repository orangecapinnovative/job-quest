Welcome to TakeMeTour's Job Quest (Autumn 2016 Edition)
===

Thank you for your interest in working at TakeMeTour. First, we would like to take a simple test on your coding skill.

Please fork this repo and work on the test. After finishing the test, please send your repo to WantToWork@takemetour.com (Subject: `Full-stack JavaScript Engineer Application (Autumn 2016)`).

TODO:
---
- Install dependencies using `npm install`
- Please run this repo using `npm run build & npm start` command.
- Go to `http://localhost:3000` and explore what the project is about.
- Walk through the project's source code.
- Bad-written, isn't it? **It's your job to refactor the code!**
- Refactoring hints:
  - The code's structure does not have to be the same. Freedom is yours.
  - Implemented features should have same behavior but enhancements are welcome. (e.g. input validation)
  - Local CSS (CSS Module) is preferred.
  - It looks like the code is not in the strict format. Please do something to make sure that everyone in the team is writing code in the same format.
